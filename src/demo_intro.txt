 $text[1] = 'Rebellious slave - a complete punishment for the master. One of the most important tasks of any trainer - is to get from the slave unquestioning obedience. This is the only way that you can do further training effective and get a decent rating.'
 $text[2] = 'Slave''s willingness to obey consists from a variety of factors. It is important to know well all of them, to understand how they are produced and maintained. Listen carefully.'
 $text[3] = 'The first thing that comes to mind: fear. You can do anything you want with slave, so that in most cases it will not be difficult to intimidate her using pain, abuse and violence. We were able to calculate that the average motivation of fear almost twice as strong as any other.'
 $text[4] = 'It should however be remembered that fear has its pitfalls. Firstly, you have to be careful with punishments, so as not to cause irreparable physical harm to the girl. But even more important - not to damage her mind.'
 $text[5] = 'When you punish a slave, grows not only her fear, but also dissatisfaction. This is a direct way to drive slave into a deep depression. Without positive motivation training will be difficult, because the fear and self-pity will not give the girl to focus on learning.'
 $text[6] = 'In addition to the bad mood, fear has its own dark side. We call it angst or despair. Angst - a destructive terror emanating from a misunderstanding and rejection of fear. If slave gets punished without feeling guilt - her angst inevitably grows.'
 $text[7] = 'Sensitive girls may fall into angst simply on the fact of a bad mood. The more girl mentally and physically softer, the stronger will act fear on her, and the more likely depression. Compare the strength of punishment not only with the degree of guilt, but also with the sensitivity of the subject.'
 $text[8] = 'Angst destroys personality. Under its influence slave begin to lose temper and self-confidence, gradually turning into a mindless and faceless doll. In the early stages it can help, but in the end it will only lower her rating. Be careful.'
 $text[9] = 'To get rid of angst, try to ensure that your slave was elated. Satisfied girl will gradually forget the horror, and in addition will be much better learn the material, and well concentrating on training.'
 !cоntented - о is a russian letter, to prevent bad thing happening
 $text[10] = 'At the same time, slave that cоntented with life quickly forgets about the fear, so that you have to develop other aspects of her respect for the master for reliable obedience. Namely: habit, taming, awareness and devotion.'
 $text[11] = 'Let''s start with the habit. It is no secret that people can obey orders just because they used to do it. Every time when slave obeys your instructions and rules, her habit of slavery slightly increases. Gradually slave will just forget that she once was free.'
 $text[12] = 'While boosting the habit production is difficult, try to contain slave in severity, it will speed up the process. Proud personality will develop the habit with difficulty, but it is a habit gradually makes them forget about pride. On a par with the humiliation, of course.'
 $text[13] = 'Good foundation of obedience may be a reasonable understanding of slave''s position. Try to explain to slave that loyalty will be rewarded, and the resistance will lead to the inevitable punishment. Mind promotes reasonable obedience, but the strength of character will interfere to accept the facts.'
 $text[14] = 'Reasonable obedience can be achieved not only by direct subordination, but also through reasonable rewards. Rewarding slave, you do not just improve her mood, you give her a signal that good behavior leads to good results.'
 $text[15] = 'Be extremely careful. Rewarding slave beyond her merits, you do not only will not develop her reasonable obedience, but also make her spoiled. Spoiled slave less controllable and will always require from you positive incentives or she starts to get upset and will fall into despair.'
 $text[16] = 'In addition to reasonable obedience, theres also a instinctive obedience, when your slave subconsciously feel your superiority and strives to please you. Less temperamental people are more prone to this type of obedience.'
 $text[17] = 'To develop a slave instinct you can use punishments. When non-compliance causes in response a pain, slave produce corresponding reflex. Another way to develop the instinctive obedience - orgasms. People are subconsciously drawn to the source of pleasure.'
 $text[18] = 'Finally the top of obedience is based on the subordination of slave morality. When slave accepts her position with the heart and starts sincerely want to serve her master, we understand that she has reached a moral growth. This source of loyalty is doubly valuable because it is the most reliable.'
 $text[19] = 'Slave morality begins to appear when on the one hand slave satisfied with her position and is in a good mood, and on the other she has developed a habit, instinct and reasonable obedience. The fear here is not critical, but it is difficult to build morale on it.'
 $text[20] = 'Acknowledged whip masters are able to sharply raise their slave morale through catharsis: a special state of enlightenment, the moment of truth, comes in second of highest pain or pleasure. But this technique is available only for the bests.'
 $text[21] = 'Summing up, we can isolate some simple rules of training: punish slave, but comparable to the guilt. Reward slave, but only on merit. Give her to gradually get used to your rules. Control her orgasms. Watch for her mood.'
 $text[22] = 'In conclusion, I will say a few words about the superiority and physical resistance. You will be much easier to subdue the girl who initially feels that you are stronger and vice versa, if she sees that something is better than you, she will not want to obey.'
 $text[23] = 'On whether that will be felt your superiority is influenced by several factors. First - of course your physical strength. Second - your spiritual strength and charisma. Third - the experience of command, the ability to dominate. Finally - your appearance. Simply to submit to a spectacular and impressive gentleman.'
 $text[24] = 'But also important the slave''s personal qualities. Strong character, high emotionality and, of course, slave''s pride will prevent her to feel your superiority. Also watch out if she does feel smarter than you, thinking that she can outwit you, slave will be less inclined to obey.'
 $text[25] = 'If your superior is low, all can end even with a fight, when in response to your attempts to punish or to rape her, slave will defend herself by force. If she can beat you, the consequences can be dire. But your victory will confirm your superiority.'
 $text[26] = 'Superior itself, even very high - does not guarantee the orders execution, but accelerates the development of obedience and reduces the likelihood of physical confrontation. Keep yourself in good physical shape, develop commanding voice, watch for the appearance.'

 $text[1] = 'Let''s talk more about the punishments and rewards. In the second lecture was said about angst and spoil, but I will remind again. Punishing slave too much - we feed angst. Rewarding her with what she not deserve - we pamper and spoil slave, although improving her mood.'
 $text[2] = 'It is important to understand the key point: the merits and sins of the slave - it is not just the actual case. You should feel as she assesses her actions. Consider two examples to make it clearer.'
 $text[3] = 'Suppose that you take the innocent and not accustomed to mistreatment girl and tell her to mate with tribal bull for your entertainment. Denial in her eyes will not be a serious offense, as this demand looks for her too crazy.'
 $text[4] = 'If you brutally punish the girl for disobeying such an order, it will inevitably call angst, as she does not understand why the rejection of such a vile act can be regarded as something impermissible. But over time, things will change.'
 $text[5] = 'If your slave teeters on the edge of obedience, she will acutely feel her sin. Rejection of the same action with a bull from the already prepared girl should cause a much more severe reaction from you.'
 $text[6] = 'Same story with the awards. See not only the result, but also on a girl''s diligence. Suppose baby has agreed to a lesson on deep throating. If in the process she will make every effort, she should be good rewarded, even if you will not achieve the practical results.'
 $text[7] = 'On the contrary, even if slave doing something very well just because she can, but does not make efforts, does not show zeal - she does not deserve the award. It is even possible that you may consider in case about the punishment.'
 $text[8] = 'Get a habit to evaluate the slave''s merits and sins on a five-point system. And also evaluate the power of rewards and punishments. Let it become the rule for you: what you deserve is what you get.'
 $text[9] = 'But remember that the above said is for general guidance only. There are cases when it makes sense to punish or reward the slave more than she deserves, even at the risk of angst or spoil. Decisions are always made by you, use your experience and intuition.'
 $text[10] = 'Move on to the specific types and forms of rewards and punishments. Any impact derives its strength from slave''s specific desires and fears.'
 $text[11] = 'Punishments are based on pain, feelings of helplessness, disgust, shame, psychological vulnerability, phobias of blood, darkness, spiders, water, fire and other things.'
 $text[12] = 'Rewards may be based on the need for approval, desire for comfort, a passion for luxury, sexual pleasure or even banal if she a sweet tooth.'
 $text[13] = 'Each slave has her own strengths and weaknesses, her passions and phobias. Learn what she wants and what afraid of, and then use it for your own purposes - it is the key to a rapid gain control over a slave.'
 $text[14] = 'Imagine that you have to bring up the fearless, battle-hardened warrior. Surely you will not be able to break her will by flogging or with the sight of blood. But you can try to put pressure on her psychologically or tie her up so that she felt helpless in front of you.'
 $text[15] = 'Do not forget that a person gets used to everything. Habit is developed as to the types of exposure, and to specific types of punishments and rewards. Exceptions are only slave''s innate phobia and passion. As for the rest, be creative and try not to repeat too often.'
 $text[16] = 'Verbal rewards and punishments have one very significant advantage: they do not take a lot of time and effort, neither you nor your slave. However, this is the all pluses that this method has. Praise and swearing quickly lose strength, as well as unconfirmed by actions threats or promises.'
 $text[17] = 'You can punish a slave on the spot without any available tools. It''s quick and practical, but we must remember that tools increase the efficiency of punishments. In addition, beatings can leave bruises on the girl. Gradually traces will heal up, but so far they are still there - they will reduce her rating and charm.'
 $text[18] = 'To inflict pain, try to use at least the minimum amount of tools. Such for spanking is in ascending: slippers, belt, cane, lash and whip. Be careful using lash and whip, as the scars may remain forever. A lot depends on your skill.'
 $text[19] = 'A great advantage of the binding is that you spend not so much effort and thus inflict slave with arbitrarily long torment. Nevertheless, bondage on average slightly less effective than physical punishment of the same force.'
 $text[20] = 'If slave have erotic arousal - reward her with caress. She will not lose energy herself, moreover, a good massage can even add energy to her. But keep in mind that girl will receive the real pleasure only if she cums. Otherwise you will just grow her arousal.'
 $text[21] = 'To save your own energy, you can award slave with free time. If you just give her a rest, you may be able to use her remaining energy tomorrow. But slave will receive more pleasure if you give her the opportunity to have fun and play games.'
 $text[22] = 'If you have an extra sparks and you are not afraid that slave may gain weight, you can reward her with sweets. Rare dishes can be very expensive, but even they become boring if there are several of them in a row. When you reward slave with sweets, try to add variety.'
 $text[23] = 'Some punishments may require special equipment or rooms. At the time of examination, we do not provide torture tools and units, so you will have to manage with the minimum.'
 $text[24] = 'For some awards may be necessary to come up with a slave in the city. During training, you must not leave the walls of the guild, so that these awards also will be not available. Nevertheless, we are confident that you have enough opportunities for training.'

 $text[2] = 'Guild does not provide assistant to the exam, so you will have to manage on your own. Of course, you can use the slave for housekeeping, if she is sufficiently obedient and has the necessary skills.'
 $text[3] = 'The first thing to remember - it is your personal and slave''s hygiene. Dirt contributes to disease and reduces mood. In addition, dirty slave receive greater damage in the fight and from tortures, as she may be infected.'
 $text[4] = 'Dirt appears over time and from many activities, especially those related to loads, cleaning, cooking or dirty sex. To maintain hygiene, you should occasionally wash yourself. If you do not have a private bathroom, you will have to go to the onsen.'
 $text[5] = 'The Guild has the bathroom as a standard room, so you do not need to go into the city. You can bathe alone or together with the slave. In the second case, only she will spend her energy, but will wash you both. In addition, this should elevate your mood.'

Do not forget to carry out regular cleaning so as not to reduce the mood of all the inhabitants of the house. And remember, the bigger mess you have - the more difficult it will be to clean up.'

Slave with a good metabolism is capable to absorb about twice as many calories as regular without harm and will restore health through diet. Girl with a weak metabolism in opposite will quickly overweight and it will be difficult to return her origin shape.'
